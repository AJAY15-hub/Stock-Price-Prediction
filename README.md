# Stock-Price-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict stock prices using linear regression.
ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to predict future stock prices using Linear Regression and basic feature engineering (lag features and moving averages). It uses synthetic data (generated with trend and noise) to simulate real-world stock prices.

Tech Stack---->
-Python 
-Numpy & Pandas ðŸ“Š
-Scikit-learn ðŸ¤–
-Matplotlib ðŸ“‰


Features Used--->
-Lag features: Previous 1-day and 2-day stock prices
-Rolling mean: 5-day moving average
-Linear Regression for prediction

Output Visualization-->
-Actual price vs train/test predictions
-30-day future prediction (dashed green line)

ðŸš€ Run this project-->
-pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
-python stock_predictor.py

note-->
This project is intended for educational purposes only and does not use real stock market data. The stock prices are generated using synthetic data (trend + noise) and are not meant for actual trading or investment decisions.
